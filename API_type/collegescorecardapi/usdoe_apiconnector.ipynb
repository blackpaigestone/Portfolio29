For example, zip=12345&distance=10mi will return only those results within 10 miles of the center of the given zip code.\n",

    "By default, any number passed in the distance parameter is treated as a number of miles, but you can specify miles or kilometers by appending mi or km respectively.\n",
    "Distances are calculated from the center of the given zip code, not the boundary.\n",
    "Only U.S. zip codes are supported\n",

    "Nesting Field of Study Results\n",
    "The field of study data is included as an array of objects nested under a specified key. These objects may be queried just like any other data. However, there is an additional parameter to add to your API call to manage what is returned. By default, if specifying a search parameter, only objects of the array that match that parameter will be returned. You can pass &all_programs_nested=true to return all the items in the array instead of just those that match."
